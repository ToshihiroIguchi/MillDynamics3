# Verification suite and PBF baseline

Purpose: gate the fluid solver and the ball-fluid coupling against analytic solutions and an
energy budget, independently of the solver implementation. Added before the planned DFSPH +
boundary-particle rewrite so the rewrite is judged by numbers, not by feel. Goal it serves: power
and torque must not change when resolution, coarse-graining `k`, or sub-steps change.

Tolerance for power/torque convergence (per resolution doubling and per `k` change): **+-3 %**.

## Where things live

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Gated tests (17) | `crates/mill-core/tests/verification.rs` |
| Solver adapter (`harness`), analytic helpers, all tolerances (`gates`) | `crates/mill-core/tests/common/verification_common.rs` |
| Table / CSV probe | `cargo run --release -p mill-core --example verification_probe -- [--csv] [--res 15,25] [--cases hydro,spin,couette,energy,dry]` |
| Full-system convergence + energy columns | `coarse_graining_probe` (`power_mean_w`, `torque_mean_nm`, `budget_*_w`, `unattributed_pct_of_shaft`, `torque_from_impulse_nm`) |
| Energy ledger (read-only) | `Simulation::energy_budget()` / `reset_energy_budget()`, `EnergyBudget` in `lib.rs` |

Tests that fail on the current PBF solver are `#[ignore]`d with the measured numbers in the reason:
`cargo test --release -p mill-core --test verification -- --ignored`. A solver swap edits only
`harness`.

## Cases and gates

1. **Hydrostatic** (63 mm drum, fill 0.35): worst-5 % compression <= 0.02, mean <= 0.001,
   KE/(M g dx) <= 0.05, wall-pressure profile (wall normal impulse per polar-angle bin vs
   rho g (y_surface - y_wall) x arc) L2 <= 0.05.
2. **Impulsive spin-up** (full disc, `R^2/nu = 0.25 s`, dt 1/1920): angular momentum vs the
   Bessel-series solution within 0.03 of `L_inf` at `t nu/R^2 = 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2`; wall angular
   impulse vs `dL/dt` (exact gravity torque of the lattice included) within 0.03.
3. **Taylor-Couette** (ball `R1 = R2/2`, prescribed rotation): ball torque and wall torque within
   3 % of `T = 4 pi mu w R1^2 R2^2 / (R2^2 - R1^2)`.
4. **Energy closure** (browser defaults, 60 %Nc, wet): `|unattributed| / shaft_work <= 0.02` over >= 1 rev.
5. **Dry sub-step convergence** (10 mm media, 2 seeds; `substeps` is capped at 16): 4 vs 16 and
   8 vs 16 within 3 %.

Energy ledger terms (J/m depth; `unattributed` = dE - (shaft - ball contact dissipation - fluid
wall slip - fluid viscous - clamp removed + interface created)): the net energy change no
instrumented term explains. A closed solver has `unattributed ~ 0`.

## Baseline: current PBF solver (2026-10-01)

Only the dry sub-step test and the hydrostatic KE gate pass; everything else fails.

| Metric (gate) | res 15 | 25 | 40 | 60 | 100 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hydrostatic worst-5 % compression (0.02) | 0.098 | 0.27 | 0.68 | 1.45 | 4.49 |
| Hydrostatic mean compression (0.001) | 0.024 | 0.047 | 0.099 | 0.21 | 1.10 |
| Wall-pressure L2 (0.05) | 0.35 | 0.23 | 0.19 | 0.22 | 0.48 |
| Spin-up `|dL|/L_inf` at 0.02 (0.03) | 0.54 | 0.52 | 0.51 | 0.52 | 0.52 |
| Spin-up wall-torque mismatch (0.03) | 0.47 | 0.47 | 0.48 | 0.45 | 0.45 |
| Taylor-Couette ball torque error (0.03) | 0.996 | 0.999 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 |
| Taylor-Couette wall torque error (0.03) | 0.86 | 0.97 | 1.00 | 0.98 | 0.99 |
| Energy `|unattributed|/shaft` (0.02) | 0.20 | 0.17 | 0.80 | 4.35 | 8.40 |

Full-system, browser defaults, 60 %Nc, k=1, 3 seeds, 12 rev window (W per metre depth):

| | res 15 | 25 | 40 | 60 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wet power | 15.86 | 15.03 | 13.01 | 10.25 |
| Wet torque (N m) | 1.498 | 1.419 | 1.229 | 0.968 |
| Wet `unattributed` (% of shaft) | +21 | +18 | +79 | +429 |
| Dry power (any res) | 3.169 | | | |

`k` sweep at res 40: dry power 3.169 / 3.641 / 3.893 W at k = 1 / 2 / 4 (+15 %, +23 %); wet power
13.01 / 10.55 / 8.92 W (-19 %, -31 %). Wet ball-contact dissipation rises 1.33 -> 2.52 W with k.
Raw outputs: `fullsys_res`, `fullsys_k`, `verification_probe` (txt/csv; scratchpad, regenerate
with the commands above).

## Reading the numbers

- **Compression error grows with resolution** even without balls: the wall step has no solid
  density, so particles stack at the wall (see PHYSICS.md section 9).
- **The fluid spins up far too slowly**: at `t nu/R^2 = 0.02` the exact angular momentum is 53 %
  of rigid rotation, PBF gives ~0-1 %. Resolution-independent, so it is a model deficiency
  (velocity-blend no-slip on wall-touching particles only), not discretisation error.
- **The ball barely drives the fluid** in Taylor-Couette: torque is ~1e-5 N m against 3e-2
  analytic, with no coupling clamp hits. The heuristic Stokes-relaxation coupling is not a
  no-slip boundary.
- **Positive `unattributed` that grows with resolution**: PBF position projection reconstructs
  velocities from over-compression at the wall (energy creation); the implicit viscosity step then
  removes it (`fluid_viscous` 11 -> 48 W, res 15 -> 60). The wet viscous "dissipation" at high
  resolution is largely numerical, which is why wet power falls with resolution. (Interpretation,
  consistent with the ledger but not separately proven.)
- **Dry ledger residual -7 % (k=1) to -12 % (k=4)**: DEM predict-step energy not captured by
  `dissipated_energy_j`'s definition; small, systematic, not investigated.
- Dry power is resolution-independent but rises with `k`; wet power falls with `k`. The old claim
  that bulk quantities are `k`-invariant (PHYSICS.md section 9) is disproven.
